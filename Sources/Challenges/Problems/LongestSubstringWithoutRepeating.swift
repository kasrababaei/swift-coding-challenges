/*
 Given a string s, find the length of the longest
 substring
  without repeating characters.

 Example 1:

 Input: s = "abcabcbb"
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 Example 2:

 Input: s = "bbbbb"
 Output: 1
 Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 Example 3:

 Input: s = "pwwkew"
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
