/*
 A parentheses string is valid if and only if:
 
 It is the empty string,
 It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
 It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
 You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.
 
 For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".
 Return the minimum number of moves required to make s valid.
 
 
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: s = "())"
 Output: 1
 Example 2:
 
 Input: s = "((("
 Output: 3
